### Version Control
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. It helps in managing source code for software projects and tracking changes made by multiple collaborators.

### Difference Between Git and GitHub
- **Git**: A distributed version control system that tracks changes in the source code during development.
- **GitHub**: A web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides collaboration tools like pull requests, issues, and project boards.

### 3 Other GitHub Alternatives
1. GitLab
2. Bitbucket
3. SourceForge

### Git Fetch vs Git Pull
- **git fetch**: Downloads changes from a remote repository but does not merge them into your local branch.
- **git pull**: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local branch.

### Git Rebase
Rebasing is a way to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving the base of the branch to a new starting point.
Command: `git rebase <branch>`

### Git Cherry-Pick
Cherry-picking allows you to select specific commits from one branch and apply them to another.
Command: `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`
